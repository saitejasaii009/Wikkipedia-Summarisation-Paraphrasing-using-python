Introduction:
This task will involve using the Wikipedia API to access content from a speciÔ¨Åc Wikipedia page and then applying OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo for summarization and
paraphrasing. It's an excellent opportunity to showcase your skills in integrating APIs, handling user input, and implementing AI-based text processing. Use python
programming language. Task Steps:
Set Up the Environment: Begin by installing the Wikipedia-API package in Python. Use the command pip install Wikipedia-API. This tool will be your gateway to fetching data from Wikipedia.

Choose a Wikipedia Page: Select a Wikipedia page that interests you or is relevant to the task. This page will serve as the text corpus for your assignment.
 
This step will be taking the input from user based on his or her intrest
